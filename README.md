# **R3**	Application Architecture Diagram

To quickly walk through the diagram (right to left), it is very self-explanatory: The database that houses all user data is called MongoDB, and CRUD operations are carried out on the data it stores. The framework known as Express.js enables us to build a server with Node.js and host our website online. The technology React.js enables us to develop an interactive and responsive single page application. Finally, we build the frontend of our website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Basically, the graphic shows how users will query the database and how our application and servers will respond to that query and return a result to users. The user initially engages with the programme through the request to the backend from the user interface or front end. The database then delivers the requested information back to the backend, which in turn sends it to the frontend. The backend then sends the request to the database. The resultant data is then shown to users through the frontend.
